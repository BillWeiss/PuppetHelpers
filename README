Various helper scripts for my Puppet environment at work.

svn-pre-commit:
    My Puppet configuration is in an SVN server, and I wanted to make sure
    to not nuke my running configuration with a bad check-in (the need for
    this came about 5 minutes after I gave someone write access).  I've
    just dropped it in /var/svn/puppet/hooks/pre-commit.

    It runs puppet --parseonly on each committed .pp file to see if there
    are problems.

    This worked great for 0.25, but turns out to be almost a clone of the
    provided
    http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/1/wiki/Puppet_Version_Control
    pre-commit hook.  You should use theirs now, it's better tested
    (though, really, they're freaking close).

svn-pre-commit-26:
    Strangely, I haven't found a pre-commit hook for 2.6 and later on
    their site.  It's a trivial change, but maybe it will help someone.
