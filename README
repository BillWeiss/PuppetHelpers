Various helper scripts for my Puppet environment at work.

svn-pre-commit:
    My Puppet configuration is in an SVN server, and I wanted to make sure
    to not nuke my running configuration with a bad check-in (the need for
    this came about 5 minutes after I gave someone write access).  I've
    just dropped it in /var/svn/puppet/hooks/pre-commit.

    It runs puppet --parseonly on each committed .pp file to see if there
    are problems.
